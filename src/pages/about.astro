const defaultContent = `Welcome to my magical world! I'm Sarah, the heart and soul behind Whisked Away Bakery. 
My journey into the enchanting realm of baking began in my grandmother's kitchen when I was just seven years old, 
standing on a wooden stool, flour dusted on my cheeks, learning that the secret ingredient in every recipe is love.

After studying culinary arts in Paris and working in renowned patisseries across Europe, 
I returned home with a treasure trove of techniques and an even deeper appreciation for the 
time-honored traditions that make baking truly special. But it was my grandmother's handwritten 
recipe book that inspired me to open Whisked Away Bakery—a place where classic meets whimsical, 
where every creation tells a story.

Here at the bakery, we believe that the best recipes can't be measured in cups and teaspoons alone. 
They require a generous helping of imagination, a sprinkle of wonder, and the kind of care that 
transforms simple ingredients into moments of pure magic. Every morning, I arrive before dawn, 
ready to create treats that don't just satisfy hunger, but feed the soul.

When I'm not in the kitchen, you'll find me experimenting with new flavor combinations, 
tending to my herb garden (where I grow lavender and mint for special recipes), 
or curled up with a good book and a cup of tea. I believe that inspiration can come from anywhere—
a sunset's golden hues might inspire a new cupcake frosting, or the first spring flowers 
could spark an idea for a seasonal tart.

Thank you for letting me share my passion with you. 
Every treat is baked with love and a touch of magic just for you! ✨`;
